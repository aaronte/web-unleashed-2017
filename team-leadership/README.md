**TEAM > Process**

**Why do I lead?**
- Want to be part of something bigger than myself
- Be significant, bring value
- Want to add beautiful things in the world
- Only teams are capable of doing great things
- If you have the vision to do something big, you will have to lead a team

**Nine Innings (Learned by coaching little league baseball)**
- **You are completely responsible, but you have no control**
    - When things go wrong, you can go insane or be inspired how to bring your team to success
    - Any success is theirs, any failure is yours
    - It's not your job to do great work. It's your job to build a team that do great work
- **Everybody knows what you're about**
    - You can't hide your values
    - How you deal your weakest player says more about you than how you treat your superstars
    - How do you deal with success, how you deal with failures
    - Everyone knows what matters to you and what doesn't
    - Everyone wants to contribute; Your job is to push people to reach their goal
- **Set the standards that matter**
    - Care about doing great/high quality things and being good w/ your teammates
    - Caring about things that matter means letting other things slide: what people wear
    - Focus on things that matters the most. Others is secondary
- **Work with your team where they are**
    - Before installing new processes, focus on where they are
    - Focus on building foundation instead of things your team can't do
    - Honestly assess what your team has, and what they need
    - Do not do things that your team is not ready for
    - Don't worry about the ideal team you don't have
- **You don't have to know everything**
    - Let experts in your team train their teammates on things you don't know
    - Each person of your team is a repository of knowlege
    - Get your team to teach each other
    - Use your team to improve your team
- **You have to manage the parents too**
    - Communicate w/ boss/clients as much as you communicate your team
    - More you understand the needs/goals, the better you can direct your team
- **Make the play in front of you**
    - If your best batter in a playoff game when base is loaded and they strike out, you might be frustrated, imagine how your batter feels
    - All you can ask your team is do what is best **right now**
    - Focus your team what to be done **right now** because that's all you can do **right now**
    - Things will go wrong; shake it off; make the play in front of you
- **The last hitter still bats**
    - Everyone needs to bat; Everyone will play
    - Help them improve so they help the team
    - Work to improve your weakest players
    - If someone know they're the weakest, they would want to know they're on your side
- **Win with the team you have**
    - To win now, you have to work with the team you have now
    - Leverage your strengths, cover your weaknesses
    - Get to success w/ skills and success you have
- (EXTRA INNING) **Nothing is forever, except your reputation**
    - If you lead a team, your best players will move on. That player could be you
    - Best people go to where they're most valuable
    - Dream teams are temporary
    - Develop talent, find new players
    - Good leaders are giving opportunities to your best players to thrive while you're with them
    - You will create a reputation of nurturing excellence

**There are No Hacks**

- Do it with **Humility**, **curiosity**, and **heart**

**How do you keep positive outlook?**
- Know and believe that people want to succeed and they're doing their best to improve
