**Why Awesome?**
- Not a library. A simple pattern
- Works with any Virtual DOM library
- Virtual DOM is nice
```js
viww = function(model)
```
- How do I manage state?
    - Redux
    - MobX
    - Cerebral
    - Cycle.js
- Different Approach: [Meiosis](http://meiosis.js.org)
    - model <-- single source of truth
    - view = function(model)
    -  actions update the model
    - views call actions
